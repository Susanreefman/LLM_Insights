Soil water is now less than the refill point. Plant water stress can occur if refill status persists. At least {watershortage} mm of additional soil water is needed to achieve optimal soil water status, and there is currently storage capacity for up to {watercapacity} mm of additional irrigation and rain water. In some crops, intentional crop drying practices are sometimes needed. Dry soil conditions may be desirable in those certain situations. The circumstances are favorable for a well protected crop.;Soil water is below refill point, risking plant water stress. An additional {watershortage} mm of water is needed to reach optimal soil moisture levels, with capacity for up to {watercapacity} mm. The circumstances are favorable for a well protected crop.

At least {watershortage} mm of additional soil water is needed to achieve optimal soil water status, and there is currently storage capacity for up to {watercapacity} mm of additional irrigation and rain water. In some crops, intentional crop drying practices are sometimes needed. Dry soil conditions may be desirable in those certain situations. Immediate action by application of contact fungicide is required. The chance that the crop will be at risk soon is high. We strongly recommend to apply contact fungicide to prevent a likely infection. Consider application of systemic fungicide. Your crop might be infected with Plasmopara viticola, consider applying a systemic fungicide to suppress a recent infection from within the plant, to prevent further damage and to prevent a new infection source from within your field.;Soil water is below refill point, risking plant water stress. An additional {watershortage}  mm of water is needed to reach optimal soil moisture levels, with capacity for up to {watercapacity} mm. The chance that the crop will be at risk soon is high, immediate action is advised to prevent likely infections. 
Current soil water status is nearing the full point. Plant damage and cost inefficiency can occur if the full point is exceeded. Currently only {watercapacity} mm of storage capacity remain for additional irrigation and rain. An additional irrigation at this time could add input costs with zero or negative agronomic benefit. In situations with low root zone water storage capacity, it can be effective to apply frequent smaller irrigations;The soil water status is nearing the full point, risking plant damage and cost inefficiency if exceeded. Only {watercapacity} mm of storage capacity remain.
Soil water is currently in the optimal range for plant health. There is currently storage capacity for up to {watercapacity} mm of additional irrigation and rain water. Irrigate in the next 7 days to maintain optimal range. With current conditions, optimal status can be maintained by irrigating now or by waiting a little longer.;Soil water is at optimal levels for plant health, with capacity for {watercapacity} mm of additional water.
